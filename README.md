# AdvancedAnimation
My code for animations in Unity.

AdvancedAnimation allows you to easily add and interact with animations. Basically, you give it every major frame (in the form of a copy of the object, but only with transform), the speed of the transition between them and the style (ex. if it's accelrating, use SlowFastCurve). The AdvancedAnimation code does all the rest. In addition, you can easily interact with every variable of it through code, so if you want to change its speed/frames midway through it, you can do that (Also, I don't know how to use any other animation tool, so bear with me).

# AdvancedSpriteSheetAnimation
My code for 2D animations in Unity (AdvancedAnimation's counterpart).

This one allows you to assign multiple animations and change which one is currently playing through different scripts. You can also use SpriteSheetAnimator for single animations.
